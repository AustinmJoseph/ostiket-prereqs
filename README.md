<h2>OsTicket Configuration</h2>

Now that the site is up we need to make a few tweaks for the next lab. As you can see its missing some of the extensions. Go back to ISS and open PHP and enable the missing extensions. now we are going to go to www\root > osTicket > include > ost-sampleconfig.php and rename it to this exatcly **ost-config.php**. AFter youve renamed it right click it > properties > security > advanced > disable inheritance> remove > select principal > Enter EVeryone> and click full control. Now we can continue on the os ticket screen. name your help desk name and admin user name what ever you like. Now we have to intall HeidiSQL, open osTicket installation file and intall it. Next throught everthing and make sure the launch when done is checked. then open a new session and enter your password ROOT and the user lower case root and if that doesnt work youll have to restart the lab. If it worked a new screen should pop up the right click unnamed  then click create new and type in **osTicket** exactly. then go back on the os ticket tab  in the blank SQL Database put osTicket and root  as the SQL username and **ROOT** password  and click intall. it should give you a congradulations screen and then you can sign into our admin account with your staff control panel link and users withe the osTicket URL.
